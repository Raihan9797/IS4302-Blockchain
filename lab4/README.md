# Lab 4: Testing using Truffle, Ganache
* The assignment guides us using Dice.sol and DiceBattle.sol. However, there are some issues that are unresolved especially (point 3: making the dice battle)
* Nevertheless, it's a good template to start with for testing DiceMarket.sol

## Important notes
1. Using `truffleAssert.fails()` to test negative cases (cases that result in errors)
