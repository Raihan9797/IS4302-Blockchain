# lab 2 notes
* 1 byte = 8 bits
we can specify the sizes of different ints
because anything stored on the blockchain very ex.


declare fixed size array when possible

hashmap: O(1) lookup
struct: like an object

functions are very disgusting lmao.
no ambiguity because they scared of fking up...
solidity will actly recc u to "memory" some arrays!

we view because we are NOT changing anything!
we loop through the eles, but we never change anyth
view = no change or commits to blockchain => no gas fees!


pure: doesnt even look at the contract
payable: able ot receive ether
compiler will tell u if u need to view!


compile then deploy

what happens when ppl spam view: vibhu will check

contracts can own other contracts
smart contracts are used when you dont want users to be involved

/* eg. nft auction house
customers want to see all of the available nfts
instead of searching through the auction house address and see the blockchain
we can just use contracts to automate this process

basically a program in the blockchain
